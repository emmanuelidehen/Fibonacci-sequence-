/*
 * Write a program that generates that displays the Fibonacci sequence numbers. Your program
 * should be interative and display the range of Fibonacci sequence giving a number n (e.g 500)
 * Design and implement the fibonacci sequence using two different programming languages. Based
 * on the their corresponding charateristics and reliability vs. built time.

 Psuedo code:
 
 first declare variables
 Ask user to enter in the number
 Iput number
 check if number is grater than 1
 print 0 to the screen
 if number is greater than 2
 print 1 to the screen
 create a loop that iterates the number -2 times
 Add first number and second number and put the value in num_next
 print num_next
 set the value of second number into the first number
 set the value of num_next into the second number!
